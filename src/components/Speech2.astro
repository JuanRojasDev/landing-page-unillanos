  subtitle="Dear classmates, esteemed professors, family members, and friends who join us on this very special day, Today, we find ourselves here, in this significant moment of our lives, to celebrate not only an academic achievement but also a journey of personal growth and discovery. Our time at Unillanos, learning and mastering the English language, has been an experience that has transformed us in unimaginable ways. I still clearly remember the first day we entered the classroom, our hearts filled with nerves and expectations. At that moment, we could not foresee how much lay ahead of us: the challenges we would face, the friendships we would forge, and the invaluable lessons we would learn. This program has not only provided us with linguistic skills but has also taught us the value of perseverance, collaboration, and passion for learning. On this graduation day, my heart overflows with gratitude towards our dear professor, William Céspedes. Professor, your tireless dedication and genuine love for teaching have left an indelible mark on each of us. Your classes were always a haven of joy and growth, a place where we not only learned English but also life lessons. Every day in your classroom was an adventure, filled with laughter, discoveries, and the excitement of learning something new. You taught us to be upstanding individuals, to be supportive of others, and to value the importance of education. In your class, we never felt judged or pressured, but free to be ourselves and express ourselves without fear. Those two hours each week became our home away from home, a safe space where we could grow, make mistakes, and learn together. Professor William, your impact on our lives transcends the boundaries of language and has shaped us as human beings. Thank you for your infinite patience, wisdom, and unwavering dedication. And to my dear classmates, my friends, my Unillanos family, I want to express how much you mean to me. Each of you has left an indelible mark on my heart. We have shared laughter that has illuminated the darkest days, shed tears that have forged unbreakable bonds, and celebrated triumphs that have nourished our spirits. The memories we have created together are a treasure I will carry with me wherever I go. You have taught me the true meaning of friendship and shown me that together, we are capable of overcoming any obstacle. Personally, this journey at Unillanos has been a revelation. Thanks to the professors who have accompanied me from day one, especially Professor William, I have discovered my true calling. Your passion and dedication have inspired me to follow in your footsteps and embark on a degree to become an educator. I want to be for others what you have been for me: a guide, a mentor, and a beacon of hope. I want to create a learning environment where students feel safe, valued, and motivated to reach their full potential. This is my tribute to you, Professor William, and to all the educators who have left an indelible mark on my life. I cannot express my deepest gratitude to our families, who have been our unwavering support throughout this journey. To my parents, thank you for believing in me, for making sacrifices so that I could pursue my dreams, and for being my refuge in difficult times. And to my entire family, thank you for your love and for celebrating each of my achievements as if they were your own. You are the pillar that sustains me and the reason I keep moving forward. I also want to extend my gratitude to all the members of the Unillanos family who have made this achievement possible. To the coordinators, thank you for your leadership and dedication to ensuring that our English program is of the highest quality. To the administrative staff, thank you for your hard work behind the scenes, ensuring that everything runs smoothly. To the security guards, thank you for protecting us and providing a safe environment in which we can learn and grow. And to all the other people who are part of the Unillanos family, thank you for your daily contribution to our university experience. Each of you has left a mark on our lives and made Unillanos a second home for us. In closing, I want to share a quote from Nelson Mandela that has been a guiding light for me: “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” Today, we have not only acquired linguistic skills, but we have also equipped ourselves with the tools to face the future with confidence and determination. As we take the next steps in our lives, let us remember that our education does not end here. It is just the beginning of a journey of lifelong learning. Thank you to everyone who has been a part of this adventure. Congratulations, graduates!"
